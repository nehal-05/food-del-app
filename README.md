This is a full-stack food delivery website. I developed the front-end using React.js to create a responsive and user-friendly interface, including a shopping cart for managing food items.
Then I created a back-end API with Node.js and Express.js to handle user authentication, order placement, and data processing. Also integrated MongoDB for storing user accounts, food items, and order details, ensuring efficient database management.
Lastly, implemented Stripe payment gateway to enable secure online transactions and streamlined checkout functionality. image1, image2, image3 show the app.
